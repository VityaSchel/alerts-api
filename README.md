There was no library so I did it myself. Fuck Mail.ru and their developers. PRs are welcome, email me (vityaschel@utidteam.com) if you want to maintain this repository.

Currently supports only 2 methods: getUser; getDonations() with pagination and recursive searching, do not supports Merchandises API, do not supports polls, do not supports custom alerts.

## Installation

`$ npm i alerts-api`

## Usage

```javascript
const AlertsAPI = require('alerts-api')
/* OR USE ES6 IMPORT:
import AlertsAPI from 'alerts-api'
*/

const donationAlerts = new AlertsAPI({ access_token: '' })

async function getUserPictureURL() {
  let user = await donationAlerts.getUser()
  console.log(user.avatar)
}

getUserPictureURL()
```

## API reference

### Constructor config object

Constructor accepts exactly 1 argument: config object

```javascript
{
  access_token: 'def502...e8d',   // required; must be a string; token you obtain from exchanging authorization code
  version: 1                      // optional; defaults to 1; must be a number; version of API
}
```

### All methods

## Bonus (all scopes)

Since mailru is piece of garbage, trash, autists, dcp, patau, dodick, just dicks, ducks, idiots, motherfuckers, thieves, worst place to work if you are programming, they fucked up everything including documentation.

Fortunately for you, I screenshoted all scopes and sent it to them when documentation was fine.

Scopes may not be up to date, anyway, better than literally nothing.

Scope | Description
----- | -----------
oauth-user-show | Obtain profile data
oauth-donation-subscribe | Subscribe to new donation alerts
oauth-donation-index | View donations
oauth-custom_alert-store | Create custom alerts
oauth-goal-subscribe | Subscribe to donation goals updates
oauth-poll-subscribe | Subscribe to polls updates
